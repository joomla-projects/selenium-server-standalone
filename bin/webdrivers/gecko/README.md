## Installation

#### Inside your robofile (RoboFile.php in the root directory)

You do not have to edit your robofile if you want to use Firefox Gecko / Marionette webdriver.

Make sure you add the webdriver directory to your $PATH in order for selenium to find it.


###Setting on /tests/codeception/acceptance.suite.yml are browser
The default browser setting on /tests/codeception/acceptance.suite.yml for the browser is ``browser: 'chrome'``.
Just make sure that the browser in your acceptance.suite.yml is set to firefox.
Change the browser setting on /tests/codeception/acceptance.suite.yml to ``browser: 'firefox'``

```
