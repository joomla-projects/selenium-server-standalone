## Usage with PHP
If you want to launch Selenium from a PHP application, you could use the Selenium class.

```php
$selenium = new Selenium(array('browser' => 'chrome', 'insider' => false, 'selenium_params' => array()));
$selenium->run();
```

Possible values for browser are chrome|firefox|MicrosoftEdge|internet explorer
If you are in the Windows Insider program, you would need the edge-insiders browser. So set the insider flag to true.
