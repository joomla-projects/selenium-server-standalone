The command `composer install` will make the selenium executable from inside `bin`.

```

$ vendor/bin/selenium-server-standalone -port 4445
```

To shut down Selenium you can visit:

```bash
http://localhost:4444/selenium-server/driver/?cmd=shutDownSeleniumServer
```

## Usage with PHP
If you want to launch Selenium from a PHP application, you could use the Selenium class.

```php
$selenium = new Selenium(array('browser' => 'chrome', 'insider' => false, 'selenium_params' => array()));
$selenium->run();
```

Possible values for browser are chrome|firefox|MicrosoftEdge|internet explorer
If you are in the Windows Insider program, you would need the edge-insiders browser. So set the insider flag to true.
